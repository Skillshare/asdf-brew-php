[brew-php](https://github.com/Skillshare/asdf-brew-php) plugin for the [asdf version manager](https://asdf-vm.com).

</div>

Why this plugin? Compiling PHP is not deterministic on macOS. Relying
on existing [brew](https://brew.sh) bottles is more deterministic.
This plugin trades off compiling an explicit major, minor, and patch
level PHP for whatever precompiled major and minor version is
available in brew.

asdf plugin add brew-php https://github.com/Skillshare/asdf-brew-php.git
```

brew-php:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all brew-php

# Install specific version
asdf install brew-php latest

# Install a given minor version

## How to list versions

```shell
bin/list-all
```

## How to install a version

You can run the plugin scripts independent of `asdf`. `asdf` calls the
script with the expected environment variables. [See the
docs](https://asdf-vm.com/plugins/create.html#bin-install).

```shell
$ env ASDF_INSTALL_TYPE=version ASDF_INSTALL_VERSION=8.4 ASDF_INSTALL_PATH=tmp/8.4 bin/install
$ tmp/8.4/bin/php --version
```

# FAQ

## How does this work?

The plugin relies on versioned formulae (`php@8.3`, `php@8.2` etc) in
brew. The formulas come "bottled", meaning they are precompiled for
specific macOS versions. The pluging installs a brew formula then
links it to asdf install directory.

## What versions are supported?

8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4 at the time of this writing.

## Why are patch versions not supported?

The plugin relies on Brew formulae. Those are only pinned to minor
versions. So you can only install a minor version. The current formula
determines the patch version.

## What are the trade-offs with this approach?

The obvious trade-off is patch level version management. Relying on
brew also means the patch level may change when running `brew upgrade`
or `brew update`. So for example, say `.tool-versions` contains
`brew-php 8.4`. `asdf install` would install the `php@8.4` formula.
The formula may be set to use `8.4.1`. A future `brew update` could
update `php@8.4` to `8.4.5`. Now that `brew-php 8.4` would use
`8.4.5`.

## Are there other limitations?

- Installing "ref" say a path to a brew formula definition or a gitref
  are not suppored.

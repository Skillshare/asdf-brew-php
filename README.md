[brew-php](https://github.com/Skillshare/asdf-brew-php) plugin for the [asdf version manager](https://asdf-vm.com).

</div>

Why this plugin? Compiling PHP is not deterministic on macOS. Relying
on existing [brew][https://brew.sh] bottles is more deterministic.
This plugin trades off compiling an explicit major, minor, and patch
level PHP for whatever precompiled major and minor version is
available in brew.
